# note-taker

## In this application, I created the backend for a note-taking application. The user inputs a title, and then the note they'd like to remember. The application stores the note in a .json file so that the note can be recalled later. The user may also delete a note, by clicking the trash button. This is beneficial for someone with a busy schedule who wishes to store notes for later, and also delete notes as they see fit.
